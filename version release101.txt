I've successfully implemented authentication for office-documents.html. The page now requires users to log in before accessing the office document templates.

Authentication Features Implemented:

1.
Login Form: Created a professional login interface with username and password fields
2.
User Credentials: Set up three user accounts:
admin / tajnur2024
staff / office123
manager / docs2024
3.
Session Management: Uses browser sessionStorage to remember authentication state during the session
4.
Security: Main content is completely hidden until successful authentication
5.
User Experience:
Clean, modern login interface with company branding
Error messages for invalid credentials
Logout button in the main interface
Responsive design for mobile devices
Technical Implementation:

HTML: Added authentication container and wrapped main content
CSS: Styled the login form with gradient background and professional appearance
JavaScript: Implemented credential validation, session management, and UI state control
How to Access: Users must enter valid credentials to access the office documents. The authentication state persists during the browser session, so users won't need to re-login unless they close the browser or click logout.

Security Note: In a production environment, these credentials should be moved to a secure backend authentication system rather than being stored in client-side JavaScript.
